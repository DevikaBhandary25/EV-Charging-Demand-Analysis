# EV Charging Demand & Infrastructure Gap Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle charging station usage data to identify
peak demand hours, high-consumption zones, and infrastructure gaps.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Google Colab
- Power BI
- DAX

## Dataset
Synthetic EV charging dataset generated to simulate real-world charging behavior
without privacy concerns.

## Key Analysis
- Peak-hour EV charging demand
- Zone-wise energy consumption
- Charging station utilization
- Vehicle-type based usage trends

## Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize KPIs and support
data-driven infrastructure planning.

## Outcome
The analysis provides insights to optimize EV charging infrastructure and
improve utilization efficiency.
